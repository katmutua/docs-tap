# Security details

## <a id='app-sec'></a>Application security

### <a id='tls-encrypt'></a>TLS encryption

Supply Chain Security Tools - Store requires TLS connection. If certificates are
not provided, the application does not start. It supports TLS v1.2 and TLS v1.3.
It does not support TLS 1.0, so a downgrade attack cannot happen. TLS 1.0 is
prohibited under Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).

#### <a id='crypto-al'></a>Cryptographic algorithms

Elliptic Curve:

```text
CurveP521
CurveP384
CurveP256
```

Cipher Suites:

```text
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
```

### <a id='acc-control'></a>Access controls

SCST - Store uses [kube-rbac-proxy](https://github.com/brancz/kube-rbac-proxy)
as the only entry point to its API. Authentication and Authorization must be
completed by using the `kube-rbac-proxy` before its API is accessible.

#### <a id='auth-token'></a>Authentication

The `kube-rbac-proxy` uses [Token
Review](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/)
to verify that the token is valid. `Token Review` is a Kubernetes API to ensure
that a trusted vendor issued the access token provided by the user. To issue an
access token using Kubernetes, the user can create a Kubernetes Service Account
and retrieve the corresponding generated secret for the access token.

To create a service account and use its access token, see the [Create Service Account Docs](create-service-account.hbs.md).

#### <a id='auth-api'></a>Authorization

The `kube-rbac-proxy` uses [Subject Access
Review](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/)
to ensure that users access certain operations. `Subject Access Review` is a
Kubernetes API that uses [Kubernetes
RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) to verify
that the user can perform specific actions. See [Create Service Account
Doc](create-service-account.hbs.md).

There are two supported roles: 

- `Read Only` cluster role 
- `Read and Write` cluster role 

These cluster roles are deployed by default. Additionally,
a service account is created and bound to the `Read and Write` cluster role by
default. If you do not want this service account, set the
`add_default_rw_service_account` property to `false` in the
`metadata-store-values.yaml` file durring deployment. See [Install SCST - Store](install-scst-store.md).

There is no default service account bound to the `Read Only` cluster role. You
must create your service account and cluster role binding to bind to the `Read
Only` role.

>**Important** There is no support for roles with access to only specific types of
>resources For example, images, packages, and vulnerabilities.

## <a id='contain-sec'></a>Container security

### <a id='non-root'></a>Non-root user

All containers shipped do not use root user accounts or accounts with root
access. Using Kubernetes Security Context ensures that applications do not run
with root users.

Security Context for the API server:

```text
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
runAsUser: 65532
fsGroup: 65532
```

Security Context for the PostgreSQL database pod:

```text
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
runAsUser: 999
fsGroup: 999
```

>**Note** `65532` is the UUID for the nobody user. `999` is the UUID for the PostgreSQL user.

## <a id='sec-scan'></a>Security scanning

There are two types of security scans that are performed before every release.

### <a id='sast'></a>Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

A Coverity Scan is run on the source code of the API server, CLI, and all their
dependencies. There are no high or critical items outstanding at the time of
release.

### <a id='sca'></a>Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

A Black Duck scan is run on the compiled binary to check for vulnerabilities and
license data. There are no high or critical items outstanding at the time of
release.

A Grype scan is run against the source code and the compiled container for
dependencies vulnerabilities. There are no high or critical items outstanding at
the time of release.
