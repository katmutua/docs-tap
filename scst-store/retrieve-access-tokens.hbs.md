# Retrieve access tokens

When you install Tanzu Application Platform, the Supply Chain Security
Tools (SCST) - Store deployment automatically includes a read-write service
account. This service account is bound to the `metadata-store-read-write` role.

There are two types of SCST - Store service accounts:

1. Read-write service account - full access to the `POST` and `GET` API requests
2. Read-only service account - can only use `GET` API requests

This topic shows how to retrieve the access token for these service accounts.

## Retrieving the read-write access token

To retrieve the read-write access token, run:

```console
kubectl get secrets metadata-store-read-write-client -n metadata-store -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 -d
```

## Retrieving the read-only access token

In order retrieve the read-only access token, you must first have a read-only service account. See [Create read-only service account](create-service-account.hbs.md#ro-serv-accts).

To retrieve the read-only access token, run:

```console
kubectl get secrets metadata-store-read-client -n metadata-store -o jsonpath="{.data.token}" | base64 -d
```

## Using an access token

The access token is a Bearer token used in the http request header
`Authorization`. For example, `Authorization: Bearer
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjhMV0...`.
