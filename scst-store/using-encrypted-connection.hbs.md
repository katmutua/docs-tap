# Configure target endpoint and certificate

The connection to Supply Chain Security Tools - Store requires TLS
encryption, and the configuration depends on the kind of installation.

For a production environment, VMware recommends that SCST - Store is installed
with ingress enabled. The following instructions help set up the TLS connection,
assuming that you deployed with ingress enabled.

## Using `Ingress`

When using an [Ingress setup](ingress.hbs.md), SCST - Store creates a
specific TLS Certificate for HTTPS communications under the `metadata-store`
namespace.
