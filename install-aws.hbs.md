# Install Tanzu Application Platform package and profiles on AWS

This topic describes how to install Tanzu Application Platform packages
from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository on to AWS.

Before installing the packages, ensure you have:

- Completed the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.hbs.md).
- Created [AWS Resources](aws-resources.hbs.md)
- [Accepted Tanzu Application Platform EULA and installed Tanzu CLI](install-tanzu-cli.hbs.md) with any required plug-ins.
- Installed [Cluster Essentials for Tanzu](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cluster-Essentials-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.3/cluster-essentials/GUID-deploy.html)*

>**Important** Installing Tanzu Application Platform v1.4 on AWS using ECR as your container image registry currently requires Cluster Essentials v1.3 due to an issue with support for credential helpers in Cluster Essentials v1.4.

## <a id='add-tap-package-repo'></a> Relocate images to a registry

VMware recommends relocating the images from VMware Tanzu Network registry to your own container image registry before
attempting installation. If you don't relocate the images, Tanzu Application Platform will depend on
VMware Tanzu Network for continued operation, and VMware Tanzu Network offers no uptime guarantees.
The option to skip relocation is documented for evaluation and proof-of-concept only.

This section describes how to relocate images to the `tap-images` repository created in [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).
See [Creating AWS Resources](aws-resources.hbs.md) for more information.

To relocate images from the VMware Tanzu Network registry to the ECR registry:

1. Install Docker if it is not already installed.

1. Log in to your ECR image registry by following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry_auth.html).

    >**Note** This is a one time copy of images from the VMware Tanzu Network to ECR, so the ECR token expiring in 12 hours is not a concern.

1. Log in to the VMware Tanzu Network registry with your VMware Tanzu Network credentials by running:

    ```console
    docker login registry.tanzu.vmware.com
    ```

1. Set up environment variables for installation use by running:

    ```console
    export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=MY-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID
    export AWS_REGION=TARGET-AWS-REGION
    export TAP_VERSION=VERSION-NUMBER
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com
    export INSTALL_REPO=tap-images
    ```

    Where:

    - `MY-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID` is the account ID you depoloy Tanzu Application Platform in. No dashes and must be in the format `012345678901`.
    - `TARGET-AWS-REGION` is the region you deploy the Tanzu Application Platform to.
    - `VERSION-NUMBER` is your Tanzu Application Platform version. For example, `{{ vars.tap_version }}`.

1. [Install the Carvel tool `imgpk` CLI](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cluster-Essentials-for-VMware-Tanzu/{{ vars.url_version }}/cluster-essentials/deploy.html#optionally-install-clis-onto-your-path).

1. Relocate the images with the `imgpkg` CLI by running:

    ```console
    imgpkg copy --concurrency 1 -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages:${TAP_VERSION} --to-repo ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}
    ```

1. Create a namespace called `tap-install` for deploying any component packages by running:

    ```console
    kubectl create ns tap-install
    ```

    This namespace keeps the objects grouped together logically.

1. Add the Tanzu Application Platform package repository to the cluster by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository add tanzu-tap-repository \
      --url ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}:$TAP_VERSION \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Get the status of the Tanzu Application Platform package repository, and ensure the status updates to `Reconcile succeeded` by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    $ tanzu package repository get tanzu-tap-repository --namespace tap-install
    - Retrieving repository tap...
    NAME:          tanzu-tap-repository
    VERSION:       16253001
    REPOSITORY:    123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tap-images
    TAG:           {{ vars.tap_version }}
    STATUS:        Reconcile succeeded
    REASON:
    ```

    > **Note** The `VERSION` and `TAG` numbers differ from the earlier example if you are on
    > Tanzu Application Platform v1.4.0 or earlier.

1. List the available packages by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    $ tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    / Retrieving available packages...

## <a id='install-profile'></a> Install your Tanzu Application Platform profile

The `tap.tanzu.vmware.com` package installs predefined sets of packages based on your profile settings.
This is done by using the package manager installed by Tanzu Cluster Essentials.

For more information about profiles, see [Components and installation profiles](about-package-profiles.md).

To prepare to install a profile:

1. List version information for the package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package available list tap.tanzu.vmware.com --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Create a `tap-values.yaml` file by using the [Full Profile (AWS)](#full-profile),
which contains the minimum configurations required to deploy Tanzu Application Platform on AWS.
The sample values file contains the necessary defaults for:

    - The meta-package, or parent Tanzu Application Platform package.
    - Subordinate packages, or individual child packages.

    Keep the values file for future configuration use.

    >**Note** `tap-values.yaml` is set as a Kubernetes secret, which provides secure means to read credentials for Tanzu Application Platform components.

1. [View possible configuration settings for your package](view-package-config-aws.hbs.md)

### <a id='full-profile'></a> Full profile (AWS)

The following command generates the YAML file sample for the full-profile on AWS by using the ECR repositories you created earlier.
The `profile:` field takes `full` as the default value, but you can also set it to `iterate`, `build`, `run`, or `view`.
Refer to [Install multicluster Tanzu Application Platform profiles](multicluster/installing-multicluster.html) for more information.

```

Where:

- `INGRESS-DOMAIN` is the subdomain for the host name that you point at the `tanzu-shared-ingress`
service's External IP address.
- `kp_default_repository_aws_iam_role_arn` is the ARN that was created to write to the ECR repository for the build service. This value is generated by the script, but you can modify it manually.
- `GIT-CATALOG-URL` is the path to the `catalog-info.yaml` catalog definition file. You can download either a blank or populated catalog file from the [Tanzu Application Platform product page](https://network.pivotal.io/products/tanzu-application-platform/#/releases/1043418/file_groups/6091). Otherwise, you can use a Backstage-compliant catalog you've already built and posted on the Git infrastructure.
- `MY-DEV-NAMESPACE` is the name of the developer namespace. SCST - Store exports secrets to the namespace, and SCST - Scan deploys the `ScanTemplates` there. This allows the scanning feature to run in this namespace. If there are multiple developer namespaces, use `ns_for_export_app_cert: "*"` to export the SCST - Store CA certificate to all namespaces.
- `CUSTOMER-ENTITLEMENT-ACCOUNT-NUMBER` (optional) refers to the Entitlement Account Number (EAN), which is a unique identifier VMware assigns to its customers. Tanzu Application Platform telemetry uses this number to identify data that belongs to a particular customers and prepare usage reports. See [Kubernetes Grid documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.5/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-15/GUID-cluster-lifecycle-ceip.html#identify-the-entitlement-account-number-2) for more information about identifying the Entitlement Account Number.

For AWS, the default settings creates a classic LoadBalancer.
To use the Network LoadBalancer instead of the classic LoadBalancer for ingress, add the
following to your `tap-values.yaml`:

```yaml
contour:
  infrastructure_provider: aws
  envoy:
    service:
      aws:
        LBType: nlb
```

### <a id='full-dependencies'></a> (Optional) Configure your profile with full dependencies

When you install a profile that includes Tanzu Build Service,
Tanzu Application Platform is installed with the `lite` set of dependencies.
These dependencies consist of [buildpacks](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/services/tanzu-buildpacks/GUID-index.html)
and [stacks](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Buildpacks/services/tanzu-buildpacks/GUID-stacks.html)
required for application builds.

The `lite` set of dependencies do not contain all buildpacks and stacks.
To use all buildpacks and stacks, you must install the `full` dependencies.
For more information about the differences between `lite` and `full` dependencies, see
[About lite and full dependencies](tanzu-build-service/dependencies.html#lite-vs-full).

To configure `full` dependencies, add the key-value pair
`exclude_dependencies: true` to your `tap-values.yaml` file under the `buildservice` section.
For example:

```yaml
buildservice:
  kp_default_repository: ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/tap-build-service
  exclude_dependencies: true
```

After configuring `full` dependencies, you must install the dependencies after
you have finished installing your Tanzu Application Platform package.
See [Install the full dependencies package](#tap-install-full-deps) for more information.

## <a id="install-package"></a>Install your Tanzu Application Platform package

Follow these steps to install the Tanzu Application Platform package:

1. Install the package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package install tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v $TAP_VERSION --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
    ```

1. Verify the package install by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed get tap -n tap-install
    ```

    This can take 5-10 minutes because it installs several packages on your cluster.

2. Verify that the necessary packages in the profile are installed by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package installed list -A
    ```

3. If you configured `full` dependencies in your `tbs-values.yaml` file, install the `full` dependencies
by following the procedure in [Install full dependencies](#tap-install-full-deps).

After installing the Full profile on your cluster, you can install the
Tanzu Developer Tools for VS Code Extension to help you develop against it.
For instructions, see [Install Tanzu Developer Tools for VS Code](vscode-extension/install.md).

>**Note** You can run the following command after reconfiguring the profile to reinstall the Tanzu Application Platform:

```
tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v $TAP_VERSION  --values-file tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
```

## <a id="tap-install-full-deps"></a> Install the full dependencies package

If you configured `full` dependencies in your `tap-values.yaml` file in
[Configure your profile with full dependencies](#full-dependencies) earlier,
you must install the `full` dependencies package.

For more information about the differences between `lite` and `full` dependencies, see
[About lite and full dependencies](tanzu-build-service/dependencies.html#lite-vs-full).

To install the `full` dependencies package:

1. If you have not done so already, add the key-value pair `exclude_dependencies: true`
 to your `tap-values.yaml` file under the `buildservice` section. For example:

    ```yaml
    buildservice:
      kp_default_repository: ${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/tap-build-service
      exclude_dependencies: true
    ...
    ```

1. Get the latest version of the `buildservice` package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package available list buildservice.tanzu.vmware.com --namespace tap-install
    ```

1. Create an ECR repository for Tanzu Build Service full dependencies by running:

    ```console
    aws ecr create-repository --repository-name tbs-full-deps --region ${AWS_REGION}
    ```

1. Relocate the Tanzu Build Service full dependencies package repository by running:

    ```console
    imgpkg copy -b registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/full-tbs-deps-package-repo:VERSION \
      --to-repo ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/tbs-full-deps
    ```

    Where `VERSION` is the version of the `buildservice` package you retrieved in the previous step.

1. Add the Tanzu Build Service full dependencies package repository by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package repository add tbs-full-deps-repository \
      --url ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/tbs-full-deps:VERSION \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

    Where `VERSION` is the version of the `buildservice` package you retrieved earlier.

1. Install the full dependencies package by running:

    ```console
    tanzu package install full-tbs-deps -p full-tbs-deps.tanzu.vmware.com -v VERSION -n tap-install
    ```

    Where `VERSION` is the version of the `buildservice` package you retrieved earlier.

## <a id='access-tap-gui'></a> Access Tanzu Application Platform GUI

To access Tanzu Application Platform GUI, you can use the host name that you configured earlier. This host name is pointed at the shared ingress. To configure LoadBalancer for Tanzu Application Platform GUI, see [Access Tanzu Application Platform GUI](tap-gui/accessing-tap-gui.md).

You're now ready to start using Tanzu Application Platform GUI.
Proceed to the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) topic or the
[Tanzu Application Platform GUI - Catalog Operations](tap-gui/catalog/catalog-operations.md) topic.

## <a id='exclude-packages'></a> Exclude packages from a Tanzu Application Platform profile

To exclude packages from a Tanzu Application Platform profile:

1. Find the full subordinate (child) package name:

    ```console
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

2. Update your `tap-values` file with a section listing the exclusions:

    ```console
    profile: PROFILE-VALUE
    excluded_packages:
      - tap-gui.tanzu.vmware.com
      - service-bindings.lab.vmware.com
    ```

>**Important** If you exclude a package after performing a profile installation including that package, you cannot see the accurate package states immediately after running `tap package installed list -n tap-install`. Also, you can break package dependencies by removing a package. Allow 20 minutes to verify that all packages have reconciled correctly while troubleshooting.
