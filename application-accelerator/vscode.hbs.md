    An example URL: `https://tap-gui.myclusterdomain.myorg.com`. If you have access to the Tanzu
    Application Platform cluster that is running the Tanzu Application Platform GUI, you can run the
    following command to determine the fully-qualified domain name:

    ```console
    kubectl get httpproxy tap-gui -n tap-gui
    ```

```

## <a id="app-acclerator-known-issues"></a> Known Issues

In v0.1.5 of the Application Accelerator extension for VS Code, if an accelerator with [`custom
types`](creating-accelerators/custom-types.hbs.md) is used _and_ the custom type form contains
checkboxes, re-prioritizing the custom types entries cause the data to not properly reorder. This is
a known issue and is resolved in an upcoming release.
