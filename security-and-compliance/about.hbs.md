# Security and compliance

Security is the foremost concern of Tanzu Application Platform. For more information, see

Ingress communication uses TLS by default. Platform operators can control certificates and how they
are used by components. For more information, see [Ingress certificates](ingress-certificates.hbs.md).

For egress communication, you can establish trust for [custom CA certificates](./custom-ca-certificates.hbs.md).
