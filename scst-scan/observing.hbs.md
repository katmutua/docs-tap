Chain Security Tools - Scan components.

## <a id="observability"></a> Observability

The scans  run inside a Kubernetes Job where the Job creates a pod. Both the Job and pod are cleaned
up after completion.

Before applying a new scan, you can set a watch on the Jobs, Pods, SourceScans, Imagescans to
observe their progression:

```console
watch kubectl get scantemplates,scanpolicies,sourcescans,imagescans,pods,jobs
```
