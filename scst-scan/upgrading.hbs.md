# Upgrade Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

This topic describes how to upgrade Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository.

You can perform a fresh install of SCST - Scan by following the instructions in [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](install-scst-scan.md).

This topic includes instructions for:

  - [ Prerequisites](#-prerequisites)
  - [ General Upgrades for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](#-general-upgrades-for-supply-chain-security-tools---scan)
  - [ Upgrading to Version v1.2.0](#-upgrading-to-version-v120)


## <a id="prereqs"></a> Prerequisites

Before you upgrade SCST - Scan:

* Upgrade the Tanzu Application Platform by following the instructions in [Upgrading Tanzu Application Platform](../upgrading.md)

## <a id="general-upgrades"></a> General Upgrades for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

When you're upgrading to any version of SCST - Scan these are some factors to accomplish this task:

1. Inspect the [Release Notes](../release-notes.md) for the version you're upgrading to. There you can find any breaking changes for the installation.
2. Get the values schema for the package version you're upgrading to by running:

  ```console
  tanzu package available get scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/$VERSION --values-schema -n tap-install
  ```

   Where `$VERSION` is the new version. This gives you insights on the values you can configure in
   your `tap-values.yaml` for the new version.

## <a id="upgrade-to-1-2-0"></a> Upgrading to Version v1.2.0

To upgrade from a previous version of SCST - Scan to the version `v1.2.0`:

1. Change the `SecretExports` from SCST - Store.

  SCST - Scan needs information to connect to the SCST - Store deployment, you must change where these secrets are exported to enable the connection with the version `v1.2.0` of SCST - Scan.

  **Single Cluster Deployment**

  Edit the `tap-values.yaml` file you used to deploy SCST - Store to export the CA certificate to your developer namespace.

  ```yaml
  metadata_store:
      ns_for_export_app_cert: "DEV-NAMESPACE"
  ```

  >**Note** The `ns_for_export_app_cert` supports one namespace at a time. If you have multiple namespaces you can replace this value with a `*`, but this exports the CA certificate to all namespaces. Consider whether this increased visibility presents a risk.

  Update Tanzu Application Platform to apply the changes:

  ```console
  tanzu package installed update tap -f tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
  ```

  **Multi-Cluster Deployment**

  You must reapply the SecretExport by changing the toNamespace: scan-link-system to Namespace: `DEV-NAMESPACE`

      ```yaml
      ---
      apiVersion: secretgen.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
      kind: SecretExport
      metadata:
        name: store-ca-cert
        namespace: metadata-store-secrets
      spec:
        toNamespace: "DEV-NAMESPACE"
      ---
      apiVersion: secretgen.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
      kind: SecretExport
      metadata:
        name: store-auth-token
        namespace: metadata-store-secrets
      spec:
        toNamespace: "DEV-NAMESPACE"
      ```

2. Update your `tap-values.yaml` file.

  The installation of the SCST - Scan and the Grype scanner have some changes. The connection to the SCST - Store component have moved to the Grype scanner package. To deactivate the connection from the SCST - Scan, which is still present for backwards compatibility, but is deprecated and is removed in `v1.3.0`.

      ```yaml
      # Deactivate scan controller embedded Supply Chain Security Tools - Store integration
      scanning:
        metadataStore:
          url: ""

      # Install Grype Scanner v1.2.0
      grype:
        namespace: "DEV-NAMESPACE" # The developer namespace where the ScanTemplates are gonna be deployed
        metadataStore:
          url: "METADATA-STORE-URL" # The base URL where the Store deployment can be reached
          caSecret:
            name: "CA-SECRET-NAME" # The name of the secret containing the ca.crt
            importFromNamespace: "SECRET-NAMESPACE" # The namespace where Store is deployed (if single cluster) or where the connection secrets were created (if multi-cluster)
          authSecret:
            name: "TOKEN-SECRET-NAME" # The name of the secret containing the auth token to connect to Store
            importFromNamespace: "SECRET-NAMESPACE" # The namespace where the connection secrets were created (if multi-cluster)
      ```

  For more insights on how to install Grype, see [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan (Grype Scanner)](install-scst-scan.md#install-grype).

  >**Note** If a mix of Grype templates, such as earlier than v1.2.0 and
  >v1.2.0 and later, are used, both `scanning` and `grype` must configure the
  >parameters. The secret must also export to both scan-link-system and the developer
  >namespace. Do this by exporting to `*` or by defining multiple secrets and
  >exports. If Grype is installed to multiple namespaces there must be
  >corresponding exports. See [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan (Grype
  >Scanner)](install-scst-scan.md#install-grype).

  Now update Tanzu Application Platform to apply the changes:

  ```console
  tanzu package installed update tap -f tap-values.yaml -n tap-install
  ```

3. Update the `ScanPolicy` to include the latest structure changes for `v1.2.0`.

  To update to the latest valid Rego File in the `ScanPolicy`, [Enforce compliance policy using Open Policy Agent](policies.md). `v1.2.0` introduced some breaking changes in the Rego File structure used for the `ScanPolicies`, See the [Release Notes](../release-notes.md#scst-scan-changes).

4. Verify the upgrade.

  You can run any `ImageScan` or `SourceScan` in your `<DEV-NAMESPACE>` where the Grype Scanner was installed, and it finishes. Here is a sample you can try to run to detect if everything upgraded.

  Create the `verify-upgrade.yaml` file in your system with the following content:

    ```yaml
    ---
    apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
    kind: ScanPolicy
    metadata:
      name: scan-policy
      labels:
        'app.kubernetes.io/part-of': 'enable-in-gui'
    spec:
      regoFile: |
        package main

        # Accepted Values: "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low", "Negligible", "UnknownSeverity"
        notAllowedSeverities := ["Critical", "High", "UnknownSeverity"]
        ignoreCves := []

        contains(array, elem) = true {
          array[_] = elem
        } else = false { true }

        isSafe(match) {
          severities := { e | e := match.ratings.rating.severity } | { e | e := match.ratings.rating[_].severity }
          some i
          fails := contains(notAllowedSeverities, severities[i])
          not fails
        }

        isSafe(match) {
          ignore := contains(ignoreCves, match.id)
          ignore
        }

        deny[msg] {
          comps := { e | e := input.bom.components.component } | { e | e := input.bom.components.component[_] }
          some i
          comp := comps[i]
          vulns := { e | e := comp.vulnerabilities.vulnerability } | { e | e := comp.vulnerabilities.vulnerability[_] }
          some j
          vuln := vulns[j]
          ratings := { e | e := vuln.ratings.rating.severity } | { e | e := vuln.ratings.rating[_].severity }
          not isSafe(vuln)
          msg = sprintf("CVE %s %s %s", [comp.name, vuln.id, ratings])
        }
    ---
    apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
    kind: ImageScan
    metadata:
      name: sample-public-image-scan
    spec:
      registry:
        image: "nginx:1.16"
      scanTemplate: public-image-scan-template
      scanPolicy: scan-policy
    ```

  Deploy the resources

  ```console
  kubectl apply -f verify-upgrade.yaml -n DEV-NAMESPACE
  ```

  View the scan results

  ```console
  kubectl describe imagescan sample-public-image-scan -n DEV-NAMESPACE
  ```

  If it is successful, the `ImageScan` goes to the `Failed` phase and shows the results of the scan in the `Status`.
