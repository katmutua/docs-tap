# Configure image signing and verification in your supply chain

This how-to guide walks you through configuring your supply chain to sign and verify your image builds.

## <a id="you-will"></a>What you will do

  - Configure your supply chain to sign your image builds.
  - Configure an admission control policy to verify image signatures before admitting pods to the cluster.

1. Use cosign to configure Tanzu Build Service to sign your container image builds. For instructions, see [Configure Tanzu Build Service to sign your image builds](../tanzu-build-service/tbs-image-signing.md).

2. Create a `values.yaml` file, and install the Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller. For instructions, see [Install Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller](../scst-policy/install-scst-policy.md).

3. Create a `ClusterImagePolicy` that passes Tanzu Application Platform images. It is planned for a future release for these to be signed and verifiable, but currently we recommend creating a policy to pass them:

    For example:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f - -o yaml << EOF
    ---
    apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterImagePolicy
    metadata:
      name: image-policy-exceptions
    spec:
      images:
      - glob: registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages*
      - glob: REPO-NAME*
      authorities:
      - static:
          action: pass
    EOF
    ```

    Where:

    - `REPO-NAME` is the repository in your registry where Tanzu Build Service dependencies are stored. This is the exact same value conigured in the `kp_default_repository` inside your `tap-values.yaml` or `tbs-values.yaml` files. Examples:
      - Harbor has the form `"my-harbor.io/my-project/build-service"`.
      - Docker Hub has the form `"my-dockerhub-user/build-service"` or `"index.docker.io/my-user/build-service"`.
      - Google Cloud Registry has the form `"gcr.io/my-project/build-service"`.

    Add any unsigned image that must run in your namespace to the previous policy.
    For example, if you add a Tekton pipeline that runs a gradle image for testing, you need
    to add `glob: index.docker.io/library/gradle*` to `spec.images.glob` in the preceding code. If you relocated
    the Tanzu Application Platform images to your own registry,
    replace `registry.tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu-application-platform/tap-packages`
    with the new target repository.

4. Configure and apply at least one `ClusterImagePolicy` resource to the cluster to verify image signatures when deploying resources. For instructions, see [Create a `ClusterImagePolicy` resource](../scst-policy/configuring.md#create-cip-resource).

    For example:

    ```console
    kubectl apply -f - -o yaml << EOF
    ---
    apiVersion: policy.sigstore.dev/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterImagePolicy
    metadata:
      name: example-policy
    spec:
      images:
      - glob: registry.example.org/myproject/*
      authorities:
      - key:
          data: |
            -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
            <content ...>
            -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    EOF
    ```

5. Enable the policy controller verification in your namespace by adding the label
`policy.sigstore.dev/include: "true"` to the namespace resource.

    For example:

    ```console
    kubectl label namespace YOUR-NAMESPACE policy.sigstore.dev/include=true
    ```

    Where `YOUR-NAMESPACE` is the name of your secure namespace.

>**Note** Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy Controller only validates resources in namespaces
that have chosen to opt in.

When you apply the `ClusterImagePolicy` resource, your cluster requires valid signatures for all images that match the `spec.images.glob[]` you define in the configuration. For more information about configuring an image policy, see [Configuring Supply Chain Security Tools - Policy](../scst-policy/configuring.md).
