# Application Single Sign-On for VMware Tanzu® {{ vars.app-sso.version }}

Application Single Sign-On for VMware Tanzu® (AppSSO) provides APIs for curating and consuming a "Single
Sign-On as a service" offering on Tanzu Application Platform.

To get started with AppSSO, see [Get started with Application Single Sign-On](getting-started/appsso-overview.md).

With AppSSO, Service Operators can configure and deploy authorization servers. Application Operators can then
configure their Workloads with these authorization servers to provide Single Sign-On to their end-users.

AppSSO allows integrating authentication and authorization decisions early in the software development and release
life cycle. It provides a seamless transition for workloads from development to production when including Single Sign-On
solutions in your software.

It's easy to get started with AppSSO, deploy an authorization server with static test users, and eventually progress to
multiple authorization servers of production-grade scale with token key rotation, multiple upstream identity providers,
configured secure storage, and client restrictions.

AppSSO's authorization server is based off of Spring Authorization Server project.
For more information, see [Spring documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-authorization-server).
