# Deploy an application with Application Single Sign-On

> **Important** This topic assumes that you have completed the steps described in [Get started with Application Single Sign-On](appsso-overview.hbs.md). 
If not, see [Provision a client registration](client-registration.md).

In this tutorial, you are going to deploy a minimal Kubernetes application that uses the credentials created through 
the [ClientRegistration](client-registration.md) and be protected through SSO.

![Diagram of AppSSO's components and how they interact with End-Users and Client applications](../../images/app-sso/appsso-concepts.png)

For more information about how a Client application uses an AuthServer to authenticate an End-User, see [AppSSO Overview](appsso-overview.md).

## Deploy a minimal application

You are going to deploy a two-container pod, as a test application.

> **Important** AppSSO uses `test-app.example.com` for `HTTPProxy.spec.virtualhost.fqdn`. You must customize the URL to
match the domain of your Tanzu Application Platform cluster. This URL must match what was set up in `ClientRegistration.spec.redirectURIs[0]`
in [Provision a client registration](client-registration.hbs.md)

Now you can navigate to `http://test-app.example.com/`. It may ask you to log into the
AuthServer you haven't already. You can also navigate to `http://test-app.example.com/token` if you wish to see the
contents of the ID token.

## Deployment manifest

The application was deployed as a two-container pod: one for the app, and one for handling login.

- The main container is called `application`, and runs a bare-bones Python HTTP server, that reads from
  the `Authorization` header from incoming requests and returns the decoded `id_token`.
- The second container, called `proxy`, is a sidecar container, an "Ambassador". It receives traffic for the Pod,
  performs OpenID authentication using [OAuth2 Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/), and proxies
  requests to the `application` with some added headers containing identity information.

Along with this deployment, there is a `Service` + `HTTPProxy`, to expose the application to the outside world.

## OAuth2-Proxy

The setup of the above [OAuth2 Proxy](https://oauth2-proxy.github.io/oauth2-proxy/) is minimal, and is not considered
suitable for production use. To configure it for production, please refer to the official documentation.

Note that OAuth2 Proxy requires some claims to be present in the `id_token`, notably the `email` claim and the
non-standard `groups` claim. The `groups` claim maps to AppSSO's `roles` claim. Therefore, for this proxy to work with
AppSSO, users _MUST_ have an e-mail defined, and at least one entry in `roles`. If the proxy container logs an error
stating `Error redeeming code during OAuth2 callback: could not get claim "groups" [...]`, make sure that the user
has `roles` provided in the `identityProvider`.
