# Application Single Sign-On for Service Operators

`AuthServer` represents the request for an OIDC authorization server. It results in the deployment of an authorization
server backed by Redis over mutual TLS if no [external storage](storage.hbs.md) is explicitly configured.

You can configure the labels with which clients can select an `AuthServer`, the namespaces it allows clients from,
its issuer URI, its token signature keys, identity providers and further details for its deployment.

For the full available configuration, `spec` and `status` see [the API reference](../crds/authserver.md).

The following sections outline the essential steps to configure a fully operational authorization server.
