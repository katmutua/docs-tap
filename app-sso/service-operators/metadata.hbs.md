# Annotations and labels

An `AuthServer` is selectable by `ClientRegistration` through labels. The namespace an `AuthServer`
allows `ClientRegistrations` from is controlled with an annotation.

## Labels

`ClientRegistrations` select an `AuthServer` with `spec.authServerSelector`. Therefore, an `AuthServer`
must have a set of labels that uniquely identifies it amongst all `AuthServer`. A `ClientRegistration` must match only
one `AuthServer`. Registration fails if multiple or no `AuthServer` resources are matched.

For example:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: AuthServer
metadata:
  labels:
    env: dev
    ldap: True
    saml: True
# ...
---
apiVersion: sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: AuthServer
metadata:
  labels:
    env: prod
    saml: True
# ...
```

## Allowing client namespaces

`AuthServer` controls which namespace it allows `ClientRegistrations` with the annotation:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: AuthServer
metadata:
  annotations:
    sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/allow-client-namespaces: "*"
```

To allow `ClientRegistrations` from all or a restricted set of namespaces this annotation must be set. Its value is a
comma-separated list of allowed Namespaces, e.g. `"app-team-red,app-team-green"`, or `"*"` if it should allow clients
from all namespaces.

>**Caution** If the annotation is missing, no clients are allowed.

## Unsafe configuration

`AuthServer` is designed to enforce secure and production-ready configuration. However, sometimes it is necessary
to opt-out of those constraints, e.g. when deploying `AuthServer` on an _iterate_ cluster.

>**Caution** Allowing **unsafe** is not recommended for production.

### Unsafe identity provider

The `InternalUnsafe` identity provider cannot be used unless explicitly allowed by including the annotation
`sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/allow-unsafe-identity-provider` as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: AuthServer
metadata:
  annotations:
    sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/allow-unsafe-identity-provider: ""
spec:
  identityProviders:
    - name: static-users
      internalUnsafe:
      # ...
```

If the annotation is not present and an `InternalUnsafe` identity provider is configured the `AuthServer` will not
apply.

### Unsafe issuer URI

It's not possible to use a plain HTTP issuer URI, unless it's explicitly allowed by including the 
annotation `sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/allow-unsafe-issuer-uri` as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1alpha1
kind: AuthServer
metadata:
  annotations:
    sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/allow-unsafe-issuer-uri: ""
spec:
  issuerURI: http://this.is.unsafe
```

If the annotation is not present and a plain HTTP issuer URI is configured, the `AuthServer` does not apply.
