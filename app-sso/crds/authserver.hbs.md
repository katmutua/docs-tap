# AuthServer

`AuthServer` represents the request for an OIDC authorization server. It causes the deployment of an authorization
server backed by Redis over mutual TLS if no storage is defined.

An `AuthServer` should have labels which allow to uniquely match it amongst others. `ClientRegistration` selects an
`AuthServer` by label selector and needs a unique match to be successful.

To allow `ClientRegistrations` from all or a restricted set of Namespaces, the
annotation `sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/allow-client-namespaces` must be set. Its value is a comma-separated list of
allowed Namespaces, e.g. `"app-team-red,app-team-green"`, or `"*"` if it should allow clients from all namespaces. If
the annotation is missing, no clients are allowed.

The issuer URI, which is the point of entry for clients and end-users, is constructed through the package's `domain_template`.
You can view the issuer URI by running
`kubectl get authserver -n authservers`.

See [Issuer URI & TLS](../service-operators/issuer-uri-and-tls.md) for more information.

Token signature keys are configured by using `spec.tokenSignature`. This is a required field. See
[Token signatures](../service-operators/token-signature.md) for more context.

Identity providers are configured under `spec.identityProviders`. If there are none, end-users won't be able to log in.

The deployment can be further customized by configuring replicas, resources, http server and logging properties.

An `AuthServer` reconciles into the following resources in its namespace:

```text
AuthServer/my-authserver
├─Certificate/my-authserver-redis-client                   # if no storage is defined

Alternatively, you can interactively discover the spec with:

```shell
kubectl explain authservers.sso.apps.tanzu.vmware.com
```

## Status & conditions

The `.status` subresource helps you to learn the `AuthServer`'s readiness, resulting deployments, attached clients and
to troubleshoot issues.

`.status.issuerURI` is the templated issuer URI. This is the entry point for any traffic.

`.status.tls` is the actual TLS configuration.

`.status.tokenSignatureKeyCount` is the number of currently configured token signature keys.

`.status.clientRegistrationCount` is the number of currently registered clients.

`.status.deployments.authServer` describes the current authorization server deployment by listing the running image,
its replicas, the hash of the current configuration and the generation which has last resulted in a restart.

`.status.deployments.redis` describes the current provided Redis deployment by listing its running image. This field is
nil if storage is defined explicitly by using `.spec.storage`.

`.status.storage.redis` describes the configured Redis storage such as host name and port number.

`.status.conditions` documents each step in the reconciliation:

- `Valid`: Is the spec valid?
- `ImagePullSecretApplied`: Has the image pull secret been applied?
- `SignAndVerifyKeyResolved`: Has the single sign-and-verify key been resolved?
- `ExtraVerifyKeysResolved`: Have the single extra verify keys been resolved?
- `IdentityProvidersResolved`: Has all identity provider configuration been resolved?
- `ConfigResolved`: Has the complete configuration for the authorization server been resolved?
- `AuthServerConfigured`: Has the complete configuration for the authorization server been applied?
- `IssuerURIReady`: Is the authorization server yet responding to `{.status.issuerURI}/.well-known/openid-configuration`?
- `Ready`: whether all the previous conditions are "True"

The super condition `Ready` denotes a fully successful reconciliation of a given `ClientRegistration`.

If everything goes well you will see something like this:

```yaml
issuerURI: "https://..."
observedGeneration: 1
tokenSignatureKeyCount: 0
clientRegistrationCount: 0
caCerts:
  - cert:
      subject: ""

    message: ""
    reason: Valid
    status: "True"
    type: Valid
```

## RBAC

The `ServiceAccount` of the authorization server has a `Role` with the following permissions:

```yaml
- apiGroups:
    - ""
  resources:
    - secrets
  verbs:
    - get
    - list
    - watch
  resourceNames:
    - { name }-auth-server-keys
    - { name }-auth-server-clients
```

## Example

This example requests an authorization server with two token signature keys and two identity providers.

>**Note** The label used for matching to ClientRegistrations must be unique across namespaces.
