# Use Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio

> **Note** This extension is in the beta stage of development.

This topic describes how to use Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio.

## <a id="apply-workload"></a> Apply a workload

To apply a workload:

1. Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

   - The Tanzu CLI is installed in a location included in your `PATH` environment variable.
   - A valid `workload.yaml` file is in the project. For more information, see the specification for
     [Tanzu apps workload apply](../cli-plugins/apps/command-reference/workload_create_update_apply.hbs.md).
   - You have a functional Tanzu Application Platform environment.
   - Your kubeconfig file is modified for Tanzu Application Platform workload deployments.
     There must be a preferred `namespace`, for example.
   - You have an image repository to which source code in the local file system can be uploaded
     before Build Service builds it.

2. Right-click the project node or any file node in the Solution Explorer.
3. Click **Tanzu: Apply Workload**.
4. Specify an address to your image repository in the confirmation dialog box.
5. (Optional) adjust additional settings for the `apply` path to your local source code, Kubernetes
   namespace, and path to `workload.yaml`.
   If a `workload.yaml` file exists somewhere in the project file structure, it is used by default.
6. Click **Apply Workload**.
7. Verify that output appears in the Tanzu Output pane of the Visual Studio Output tool window.

## <a id="delete-workload"></a> Delete a workload

To delete a workload:

1. Ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

   - The Tanzu CLI is installed in a location included in your `PATH` environment variable.
   - A running Tanzu Application Platform workload.
   - A valid `workload.yaml` file in the project that describes the workload to delete.
   - A `namespace` set in `Kube config/Kubecontext` that matches with where the workload was deployed
     either by using `Workload Apply` or `Live Update`.

1. Right-click the project node or any file node in the Solution Explorer.
1. Click **Tanzu: Delete Workload**. If a `workload.yaml` file exists somewhere in the project file
   structure, the extension uses it to delete the workload by running

   ```console
   tanzu apps workload delete --file={workload_path} --yes
   ```

## <a id="use-live-update"></a> Use Live Update

To use Live Update:

1. Ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

   - A project with a `Tiltfile` in the project root.
   - The Tilt CLI is installed in a location included in your `PATH` environment variable.
   - The Tanzu CLI is installed in a location included in your `PATH` environment variable.
   - The `namespace` you use matches the `namespace` where the workload is running, if it was
     deployed already by using `Apply Workload`.
   - You can `Build` the code within Visual Studio.
   - The `Debug` sub folder is in the output folder.

2. Start Live Update by right-clicking on any project or file node in the solution explorer and then
   clicking **Tanzu: Start Live Update**.
3. Stop Live Update by right-clicking on any project or file node in the solution explorer and then
   clicking **Tanzu: Stop Live Update**.

### <a id="stop-rogues"></a> Stop rogue Tilt processes

If a `tilt` process is already running and you try to start Live Update, a message in the Tanzu Output
window appears, which is similar to:

```console
Error: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:10350: bind: Only one usage of each socket address \
(protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.
```

To resolve this, stop any running `tilt` processes. The following example is a PowerShell snippet,
but you can get a similar result by using Task Manager.

```console
Get-Process "tilt" | ForEach-Object { $_.kill() }
```

## <a id='lv-update-path-not-found'></a> Live Update failure because the system cannot find the path specified

### Symptom

In v0.1.0 and earlier, the `Tanzu: Start Live Update` command gives the following error message
when first run:

```console
The system cannot find the path specified
```

### Cause

The Tiltfile is configured to direct output to the location that Unix operating systems use for
discarding output, `/dev/null`. This doesn't work on Windows machines, which use `NUL` instead.

### Solution

In your Tiltfile, change the line

```text
OUTPUT_TO_NULL_COMMAND = os.getenv("OUTPUT_TO_NULL_COMMAND", default=' > /dev/null ')
```

to

```text
OUTPUT_TO_NULL_COMMAND = os.getenv("OUTPUT_TO_NULL_COMMAND", default=' > NUL ')
```

This makes the path discoverable and enables Live Update to run.

## <a id="use-remote-debug"></a> Use Remote Debug

Before using Remote Debug, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- A running .NET workload in Tanzu Application Platform.
- The Tanzu CLI is installed in a location included in your `PATH` environment variable.
- The Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) is installed in a location included in your `PATH` environment variable.

### <a id="run-workload"></a> Run a workload in Tanzu Application Platform

To run a workload in Tanzu Application Platform:

1. Clone the project
   [`steeltoe-weatherforecast` accelerator](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-accelerator-samples/tree/main/weatherforecast-steeltoe),
   which provides a sample .NET app that is ready for immediate deployment to Tanzu Application Platform.
1. Go to `weatherforecast-steeltoe`.
1. Right-click on the project node and then click **Tanzu: Apply Workload**.
   For more information, see
   [Tanzu apps workload apply](../cli-plugins/apps/command-reference/workload_create_update_apply.hbs.md).

### <a id="start-remote-debug"></a> Start Remote Debug

To start a remote debug, right-click on a project in the Solution Explorer and then click on
**Tanzu: Remote Debug**.

- If no workload pods are running, you are prompted to deploy a new workload.
  If you want to do so, click on **OK** in the dialog box and proceed with the steps in
  [Apply a Workload](#apply-workload).
  After the workload is deployed, click **Tanzu: Remote Debug** again to start debugging.

- If just one workload pod is running, the debugger attaches to your running app process
  automatically.

- If more than one workload pod is running, you are prompted to select the workload that corresponds
  to the project you want to debug. Select the relevant pod name and then click **Begin Debugging**.
  The pod confirmation window then closes and the Output window opens to the Debug Adapter Host Log
  pane as Visual Studio enters debug mode.

Visual Studio prompts the debugging agent to attach to a running app process with the name
`/workspace/DOT-NET-PROJECT-NAME`.

> **Caution** If the name of your running app process (the app DLL process), does not match the name
> of your .NET project as shown in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer, the remote debugging agent
> might fail to attach.

A file named `.tanzu-vs-launch-config.json` is created at the root directory of your project.
This file specifies the configuration needed to attach Visual Studio's debugger to the agent running
in your workload's container.
It is only needed to initiate remote debugging and can be safely deleted at any time.
This file location is temporary and will change in future versions.

### <a id="stop-remote-debug"></a> Stop Remote Debug

Using the red square stop button in Visual Studio's top toolbar can cause the Tanzu Application Platform
workload to fail or become unresponsive indefinitely.
A fix is planned for a future release. In the meantime, open the **Debug** menu and click **Detach All**.

## <a id="troubleshoot"></a> Troubleshooting

This extension records logs in a `.log` file whose name starts with `tanzu-dev-tools` and ends with
a string of numbers representing the date, such as `tanzu-dev-tools20221202.log`.
A new log file is created for each day and retained for a maximum of 31 days.
These log files are in the installation directory of the `.vsix` file.
By default, this is

```text
C:\Users\NAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\VERSION\Extensions\VMware\Tanzu Developer Tools\VSIX-VERSION
```

Where `NAME`, `VERSION`, and `VSIX-VERSION` are placeholders.
